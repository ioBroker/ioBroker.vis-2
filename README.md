## Bindings of objects
Normally, most of the widgets have ObjectID attribute and this attribute can be bound with some value of object ID.
But there is another option for how to bind *any* attribute of widget to some ObjectID. 

Just write into attribute `{object.id}` and it will be bound to this object's value. 
If you use the special format, you can even make some simple operations with it, e.g., multiplying or formatting.

E.g., to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle:

`{h:javascript.0.myCustom.height;w:javascript.0.myCustom.width;Math.max(20, Math.sqrt(h*h + w*w))}` will be interpreted as function:

```
value = await (async function () {
    var h = (await getState('javascript.0.myCustom.height')).val;
    var w = (await getState('javascript.0.myCustom.width')).val;
    return Math.max(20, Math.sqrt(h * h + w * w));
})();
```

or 

`{h:javascript.0.myCustom.height;w:javascript.0.myCustom.width;h*w}` will just multiply height with width.


You can use *any* javascript (browser) functions. Arguments must be defined with ':', if not, it will be interpreted as formula.

Take care about types. All of them are defined as strings. To be sure, that value will be treated as number use parseFloat function.

So our Hypotenuse calculation will be:
```
{h:javascript.0.myCustom.height;w:javascript.0.myCustom.width;Math.max(20, Math.sqrt(Math.pow(parseFloat(h), 2) + Math.pow(parseFloat(w), 2)))}
```

### Deprecated format
Patten has the following format:

```
{objectID;operation1;operation2;...}
```

The following operations are supported:

- `*` - multiplying. Argument must be in brackets, like "*(4)". In this sample, we multiply the value with 4.
- `+` - add. Argument must be in brackets, like "+(4.5)". In this sample we add to value 4.5.
- `-` - subtract. Argument must be in brackets, like "-(-674.5)". In this sample we subtract from value -674.5.
- `/` - dividing. Argument must be in brackets, like "/(0.5)". In this sample, we divide the value by 0.5.
- `%` - modulo. Argument must be in brackets, like "%(5)". In this sample, we take modulo of 5.
- `round` - round the value.
- `round(N)` - round the value with N places after point, e.g., 34.678;round(1) => 34.7
- `hex` - convert value to hexadecimal value. All letters are lower cased.
- `hex2` - convert value to hexadecimal value. All letters are lower cased. If value less 16, so the leading zero will be added.
- `HEX` - same as hex, but upper-cased.
- `HEX2` - same as hex2, but upper-cased.
- `date` - format date according to given format. Format is the same as in [iobroker.javascript](https://github.com/iobroker/iobroker.javascript/blob/master/README.md#formatdate)
- `min(N)` - if value is less than N, take the N, else value
- `max(M)` - if value is greater than M, take the M, else value
- `sqrt` - square root
- `pow(n)` - power of N.
- `pow` - power of 2.
- `floor` - Math.floor
- `ceil` - Math.ceil
- `json` - operation for getting json or object property. E.g., `{id;json(common.name.en)}`
- `random(R)` - Math.random() * R, or just Math.random() if no argument
- `formatValue(decimals)` - format value according to system settings and use decimals
- `date(format)` - format value as date. The format is like: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.sss"
- `momentDate(format, useTodayOrYesterday)` - format value as date using Moment.js. [Approved formats must be entered according to the moment.js library](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/). With `useTodayOrYesterday=true` the `moment.js` format `ddd`/`dddd` are overwritten with today / yesterday
- `array(element1,element2[,element3,element4])` - returns the element of index. e.g.: `{id.ack;array(ack is false,ack is true)}`

You can use this pattern in any text, like

```
My calculations with {objectID1;operation1;operation2;...} are {objectID2;operation3;operation4;...}
```

or color calculations:

```
#{objectRed;/(100);*(255);HEX2}{objectGreen;HEX2}{objectBlue;HEX2}
```

To show timestamp of object write `.ts` or `.lc` (for last change) at the end of object id, e.g.:

```
Last change: {objectRed.lc;date(hh:mm)}
```

### Special bindings
There are a number of different internal bindings to provide additional information in views:
* `username` - shows logged-in user
* `view` - name of actual view
* `wname` - widget name
* `widget` - is an object with all data of widget. Can be used only in JS part, like `{a:a;widget.data.name}`
* `wid` - name of actual widget
* `language` - can be `de`, `en` or `ru`.
* `instance` - browser instance
* `login` - if login required or not (e.g., to show/hide logout button)
* `local_*` - if state name is started from `local_` it will not be reported to ioBroker but will update all widgets, that depends on this state. (Local variable for current browser session)

Note: to use ":" in calculations (e.g., in string formula) use "::" instead.

**Remember**, that style definitions will be interpreted as bindings, so use `{{style: value}}` or just

```
{
	style: value
}
```

for that.

## Filters
To visualize on the one view the whole number of widgets, you can use filters to reduce the count of widgets simultaneously shown on the view.
 
Every widget has a field `filter`. If you set it to some value, e.g. `light`, so you can use other widget `(bars - filters, filter - dropdown)` to control which filter is actually active.

## Control interface
Vis creates 3 variables:

- `control.instance` - Here the browser instance should be written or `FFFFFFFF` if every browser must be controlled.
- `control.data`     - Parameter for command. See specific command description.
- `control.command`  - Command name. Write this variable triggers the command. That means before command will be written, the "instance" and "data" must be prepared with data.

Commands:

* `alert` - show an alert window in the vis-2. "control.data" has the following format "message;title;jquery-icon". Title and jquery-icon are optional. Icon names can be found [here](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/). To show icon "ui-icon-info" write `Message;;info`.
* `changeView` - switch to desired view. "control.data" must have the name of view. You can specify the project name too as `project/view`. The default project is `main`.
* `refresh` - reload the vis-2, for instance after the project is changed to reload on all browsers.
* `reload` - same as refresh.
* `dialog` - Show dialog window. Dialog must exist on view. One of:

    - `static    - HTML    - Dialog`,
    - `static    - Icon    - Dialog`,
    - `container - HTML    - view in jqui Dialog`,
    - `container - ext cmd - view in jqui Dialog`,
    - `container - Icon    - view in jqui Dialog`,
    - `container - Button  - view in jqui Dialog`.

    `control.data` must have id of dialog widget, e.g. `w00056`.
* `dialogClose`
* `popup` - opens a new browser window. Link must be specified in `control.data`, e.g., http://google.com
* `playSound` - play sound file. The link to file is specified in `control.data`, e.g., http://www.modular-planet.de/fx/marsians/Marsiansrev.mp3.
  You can upload your own file in vis-2 and let it play as for instance `/vis-2.0/main/img/myFile.mp3`.

If the user changes the view or at the start, the variables will be filled by the vis-2 with

- `control.instance`: browser instance and `ack=true`
- `control.data`: project and view name in form `project/view`, e.g. `main/view` (and `ack=true`)
- `control.command`: `changedView` and `ack=true`

You can write the JSON string or Object into `control.command` as `{instance: 'AABBCCDD', command: 'cmd', data: 'ddd'}`. In this case, the instance and data will be taken from JSON object.

Example for javascript adapter:

```
setState('vis-2.0.control.command', {"instance": "*", "command": "refresh", "data": ""});
```

## Default view
You can define for every view the desired resolution (Menu=>Tools=>Resolution).
This is only the visual border in edit mode to show you the screen size on some specific device. In the real-time mode, it will not be visible and all widgets outside the border will be visible.  

Additionally, you can define if this view must be used as default for this resolution. 

So every time the `index.html` (without `#viewName`) is called, the best suitable for this resolution view will be opened.
If only one view has *"Default"* flag, so this view will be opened independently of screen resolution or orientation.      

E.g., you can create two views "Landscape-Mobile" and "Portrait-Mobile" and these two views will be switched automatically when you change the orientation or screen size.

There is a helper widget "basic - Screen Resolution" that shows actual screen resolution and best suitable default view for this resolution. 

## Settings
### Reload if sleep longer than
There is a rule that after some disconnection period, the whole VIS page will be reloaded to synchronize the project.
You can configure it in the menu "Settings...". If you set the interval to "never" so the page will never be reloaded.

### Reconnect interval
Set the interval between the connection attempts if disconnected. If you set 2 seconds, it will try to establish the connection every 2 seconds.

### Dark reconnect screen
Sometimes (in the night) it is required to have the dark loading screen. With this option, you can set it.

Notice that these settings are valid only for reconnection and not for the first connecting.

## SVG and currentColor
The currentColor keyword in CSS allows elements to inherit the current text color from their parent element.
It can be particularly useful in SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) because it allows for more dynamic styling and easier integration with HTML content.

You can use the currentColor keyword in place of a specific color value for any property inside the SVG that accepts a color value.
Here's a simple example with a circle in an SVG:
```xml
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="currentColor" />
</svg>
```
In this case, if the SVG takes the color of parent element.
E.g., if it was used in a menu and the menu is red, the circle would be red.
